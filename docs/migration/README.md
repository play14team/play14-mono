## üöÄ Quick Start

1. **Read the main guide**: Start with [strapi-to-convex-migration.md](./strapi-to-convex-migration.md)
2. **Set up security**: Follow [MIGRATION_SECURITY.md](./MIGRATION_SECURITY.md) for environment variables
3. **Understand images**: Review [IMAGE_MIGRATION.md](./IMAGE_MIGRATION.md) for media handling
4. **Execute migration**: Follow the step-by-step process in the main guide

## üìä Migration Overview

The migration transfers all content from the production Strapi backend to Convex:

**Phase 1 - Core Data**: Tags, Event Locations, Sponsors, Venues
**Phase 2 - Main Content**: Players, Articles, Games, Events
**Phase 3 - Additional Content**: Expectations, Testimonials, Formats, History, Hosting
**Relationships**: Event hosts/mentors/attendees, Game documenters/proposers, Article tags
**Media Files**: Images and resources from Azure Storage to Convex storage

### Available npm Scripts

- `pnpm migration:test` - Test connection to Strapi API
- `pnpm migration:run` - Run complete migration (all phases)
- `pnpm migration:phase1` - Run only Phase 1 (core data)
- `pnpm migration:phase2` - Run only Phase 2 (main content)
- `pnpm migration:phase3` - Run only Phase 3 (additional content)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

- The migration includes deduplication logic using Strapi IDs
- Environment variables are required for secure API access
- Image migration is currently disabled due to storage API compatibility
- Running the migration multiple times safely updates existing records

# Strapi 5 Migration Progress Report

## Migration Status: In Progress üîÑ

### ‚úÖ Completed Steps

1. **Environment Verification**
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è Node.js v18.19.0 needs upgrade to v20+ for Azure storage provider compatibility
   - Database backup has been restored on non-production environment
   - Migration branch created (strapi5)

2. **Upgrade Tool Execution**
   - Successfully ran `npx @strapi/upgrade major`
   - Automated code modifications applied:
     - Entity service migrated to document service API
     - Cron tasks updated (with manual fixes for documentId)
     - Dependencies updated

3. **Package Updates**
   - Core Strapi packages updated to v5.20.0:
     - `@strapi/strapi`: 5.20.0
     - `@strapi/plugin-graphql`: 5.20.0
     - `@strapi/plugin-users-permissions`: 5.20.0
   - CKEditor plugin upgraded to v3.0.0 (Strapi 5 compatible)
   - Removed `@strapi/plugin-i18n` (now bundled with core)

4. **Manual Fixes Applied**
   - Fixed cron-tasks.js: Replaced "**TODO**" placeholders with `event.documentId || event.id`
   - Preserved pinned dependencies as per requirements:
     - `react-router-dom`: ^5.3.4 (DO NOT UPDATE)
     - `styled-components`: 5.3.11 (DO NOT UPDATE)

### üöß Current Issues

1. **Plugin Incompatibility**
   Multiple plugins are not compatible with Strapi 5 and have been temporarily removed:
   - `strapi-plugin-map-field` - Causes build error (JSX syntax issue)
   - `@offset-dev/strapi-calendar` - Incompatible dependencies
   - `strapi-plugin-prev-next-button` - Strapi 4 only
   - `strapi-plugin-update-static-content` - Strapi 4 only

2. **Remaining Incompatible Plugins** (need replacement/update):
   - `strapi-blurhash` - Requires Strapi 4
   - `strapi-plugin-config-sync` - Requires Strapi 4
   - `strapi-plugin-country-select` - Requires Strapi 4
   - `strapi-plugin-fuzzy-search` - Requires Strapi 4
   - `strapi-plugin-timezone-select` - Requires Strapi 4

3. **Dependency Conflicts**
   - React Router DOM and Styled Components version mismatch warnings
   - These are intentionally kept at older versions per project requirements
   - May cause compatibility issues with Strapi 5 admin panel

4. **Build Issues**
   - Yarn installation is timing out due to large dependency tree
   - Strapi CLI commands not properly recognized after partial installation

### üìã Next Steps

1. **Upgrade Node.js to v20+**

   ```bash
   # Install Node.js 20 LTS via nvm or direct download
   # Verify with: node --version
   ```

2. **Complete Installation**

   ```bash
   cd api
   yarn install --network-timeout 600000
   ```

3. **Replace Incompatible Plugins**
   - Find Strapi 5 alternatives or create custom implementations:
     - Map field ‚Üí Custom field type or alternative plugin
     - Calendar ‚Üí Alternative calendar solution
     - Country/Timezone select ‚Üí Custom field implementations
     - Fuzzy search ‚Üí Use built-in search or alternative
     - Config sync ‚Üí Manual or alternative solution

4. **Update Lifecycle Hooks**
   - Review all lifecycle files for Strapi 5 compatibility
   - Update to new document service API syntax

5. **Test Core Functionality**
   - Verify database migrations
   - Test API endpoints
   - Check GraphQL schema generation
   - Validate Azure Storage integration

6. **Address React Router DOM Issue**
   - Investigate if keeping v5.3.4 is viable with Strapi 5
   - May need custom webpack configuration to handle version mismatch
   - Consider impact on admin panel functionality

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Risk Assessment

**High Priority Issues:**

- Plugin incompatibility affecting core features (map fields, fuzzy search)
- React Router DOM version conflict may break admin panel
- Installation timeout issues preventing proper setup

**Medium Priority Issues:**

- UI enhancement plugins (calendar, prev/next buttons)
- Config sync functionality
- Lifecycle hooks may need additional updates

**Low Priority Issues:**

- Warning messages about peer dependencies
- Blurhash plugin (aesthetic feature)

### üìä Migration Progress: 60%

- ‚úÖ Core upgrade: Complete
- ‚úÖ Dependency updates: Complete
- üîÑ Plugin compatibility: 30%
- ‚è≥ Testing: Not started
- ‚è≥ Production readiness: Not started

### üí° Recommendations

1. **Consider Alternative Approach**
   - Due to dependency conflicts with react-router-dom and styled-components
   - May need to reconsider the constraint of keeping these at older versions
   - Strapi 5 is designed for react-router-dom v6 and styled-components v6

2. **Plugin Strategy**
   - Prioritize finding replacements for critical plugins (map field, fuzzy search)
   - Consider developing custom fields for country/timezone selection
   - Evaluate if all current plugins are still necessary

3. **Testing Environment**
   - Set up a clean Strapi 5 installation to test plugin compatibility
   - Compare functionality between Strapi 4 and 5 versions

4. **Fallback Plan**
   - Keep Strapi 4 branch maintained until all issues are resolved
   - Consider gradual migration approach if full migration proves too complex

## Summary

The migration to Strapi 5 has made significant progress with core packages updated and the upgrade tool successfully applied. However, several challenges remain, primarily around plugin compatibility and dependency version conflicts. The decision to keep react-router-dom and styled-components at older versions creates fundamental compatibility issues with Strapi 5's architecture.

**Next Decision Point:** Evaluate whether to proceed with the current constraints or reconsider the dependency version requirements to ensure full Strapi 5 compatibility.
